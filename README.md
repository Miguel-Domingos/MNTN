# Mountain ( MNTN )

This study project was created to practice one of the CSS features I learned at GDG Cape Town.


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```


### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Features tested

- [scroll-timeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-timeline)

# Important None
**scroll-timeline is not Baseline (stable) because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers, such as safari and firefox**
